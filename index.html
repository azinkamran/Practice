    <h1>Intersting is easy!</h1>
    <p>First,we need to learn some basic HTML. </p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>heading defines the outline of your site. Ther are six levels of headings. </p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make unordered list: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need yto be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is how you an ordered List looks like</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>you should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <p><em>sometimes</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Other times,you need to <strong>strong</strong> empheseize the importance of a word or phrase</p>
    <p><strong><em>And sometimes you need to shout!</em></strong></p>
    <h2>Empty elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Intersting should be getting easier now.</p>
    <p>Regards,<br>The Auther</p>
